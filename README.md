# 🚀 Basic ATM App

A simple and user-friendly ATM application built using Flutter. The backend operations are handled in Java through `MainActivity.java`. This project was created for an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) college assignment. The UI is currently very basic, and I plan to work on improving it in the future.

## ✨ Features

- 🔒 **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration functionality.
- 📊 **Account Management:** View account balances and transaction history.
- 💸 **Funds Transfer:** Transfer money between accounts seamlessly.
- 💰 **Deposit & Withdrawal:** Easily deposit and withdraw funds.
- 🔐 **PIN Management:** Change your PIN securely.
